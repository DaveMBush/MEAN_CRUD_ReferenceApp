# MEAN_CRUD_ReferenceApp

This project was born out of frustration.  Sure, there are a lot of MEAN demo apps on the web, but none of them
show how to create a project using the Single Responsiblity Principle.  It isn't that they put EVERYTHING in one
file, but they sure put way more in than I would like to see.

So, I wrote my own demo.  All it is meant to do is demonstrate a simple CRUD app using the MEAN stack in a way
that I can reference later to see it in a way that I understand.  If you find it useful, great.
